# SpeAR
Specification and Analysis for Requirements Tool

Spear is a tool for prototyping and analyzing requirements. It uses a simple specification
language on the front-end to ease the system's engineers transition from writing
natural language specification to formalizable specifications.

Once formalized, SpeAR will translate the specification to an equivalent Lustre model and
analyze that the specification permits (or prohibits) certain desired (or undesired) behaviors.

Work is currently underway to rebuild the SpeAR front-end and to introduce realizability into the checks already performed.
