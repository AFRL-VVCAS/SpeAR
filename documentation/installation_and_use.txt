== Software Requirements ==
1) Eclipse - http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
2) XText Plug-in for Eclipse - http://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/
3) jkind - https://github.com/agacek/jkind

== Installation/Use ==
1) Create or open an already existing workspace in eclipse.
2) Import the spear project
3) Add an xtext nature to the spear project ( right click on top-level of the 
spear project, choose "configure", then choose "Add Xtext Nature" ).
4) Expand the src directory in the spear project and then expand the spear 
directory.
5) Right click on "GenerateLanguage.mwe2" 
6) Click on "MWE2 Workflow" via the "Debug as ..." option. This will build the 
artifacts necessary to run the spear workbench.
7) Now a new debug configuration must be built. Navigate to the "Run" menu and 
then choose "Debug Configurations...". This will bring up a new window. A new
eclipse application must be made (this is done on the left portion of the 
window). The new configuration (displayed on the right portion of the window)
must be set such that the PATH environment variable includes a valid path to 
to yices and jkind. This can be done by choosing the "Environment" tab and 
following system specific details on how to extend environment variables. Save
this configuration and close it.
8) Run the newly created debug configuration.
9) A new eclipse workbench will be brought up, call this the spear workbench. A 
new workspace will need to be made and a new general project made in that 
workspace.
10) Import all examples from the examples directory in the spear project into
this new project in the spear workbench.
11) Double click on "microwave.spear" and then click on the "analyze" option in
