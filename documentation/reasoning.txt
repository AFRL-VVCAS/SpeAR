* I want to capture the discussion I had with Mike Whalen yesterday.
  + Discuss the problems with creating contracts due to lack of realization
  + This can occur because a requirement is broken
  + If we are building a tool to help requirement generation then this should be avoided.
  + Initially we require an implementation as a witness for realization
  + Types of reasoning on the table
    - Monolithic
      * not scalable
    - Monolithic with CEGAR
      * more scalable
    - Composable Verification
      * May cause problems as users try to use components in ways the designer did not intend.
